\section{Positions}
\noindent\textbf{Academia Sinica}\hfill Graduate Student Researcher\\
Taipei, Taiwan\hfill September 2020-present\\\\
- REML Research: Designed task formulation and an end-to-end retrieval-augmented pipeline to extract important signals from financial reports.\\ - RecSys Research: Designed experiments to validate the effectiveness of a new loss function compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) recommendation methods.\\ - RecSys Industry Cooperation: Researched multi-behavior algorithms for banner recommendation systems and deployed the developed model in a real-world system with millions of users.\\ - NLP Research: Analyzed the characteristics of financial annual reports and designed a new algorithm to classify sentence relations based on these findings. Leveraging the results, we conducted transfer learning in a self-supervised setting, and our paper was accepted by ACL 2023.\\ - NLP Industry Cooperation: Fine-tuned BERT with a Siamese network and contrastive loss to obtain sentence embeddings in legal data, building a retrieval system aimed at finding the most relevant internal regulations.\\
