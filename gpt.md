### Summary
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Data Science at National Taiwan University. My research interests include retrieval-enhanced machine learning, natural language processing, and recommender systems, with a particular focus on their applications in the financial domain.

### Education

- **Ph.D. in Data Science**, National Taiwan University (Since 2022)
- **M.S. in Data Science**, National Taiwan University (Admitted to the Ph.D. program in September 2022)
- **B.S. in Accounting**, National Taiwan University (2020)

### Positions

**Academia Sinica**, Graduate Student Researcher  
Taipei, Taiwan (September 2020 - Present)
- **NLP in Finance Research:** Designed task formulation and an end-to-end retrieval-augmented pipeline to extract important signals from financial reports.
- **Recommendation Research:** Designed experiments to validate the effectiveness of a new loss function compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) recommendation methods.
- **Recommendation Industry Cooperation:** Researched multi-behavior algorithms for banner recommendation systems and deployed the developed model in a real-world system with millions of users.
- **NLP Research:** Analyzed the characteristics of financial annual reports and designed a new algorithm to classify sentence relations based on these findings. Leveraged the results to conduct transfer learning in a self-supervised setting; our paper was accepted by ACL 2023.
- **NLP Industry Cooperation:** Fine-tuned BERT with a Siamese network and contrastive loss to obtain sentence embeddings in legal data, building a retrieval system aimed at finding the most relevant internal regulations.
